## Step 4: Understanding Signals

- **B Grade (70-79)**: GOOD - Solid trades
- **C Grade (60-69)**: OKAY - Proceed with caution
- **D Grade (50-59)**: WEAK - Probably skip
- **F Grade (<50)**: AVOID - Stay out!

### Reading the Scores

Each signal shows 5 component scores:

1. **V1 SMC** (0-25): Smart Money structure
2. **V2 Flow** (0-25): Order flow & sentiment
3. **V3 Auction** (0-20): Volume analysis
4. **V4 Quantum** (0-15): Probability models
5. **V5 Psychology** (0-15): Your mental state

## Step 5: Risk Management

### Before Trading

1. Set your max daily loss
2. Check your emotional state
3. Review the signal score
4. Calculate position size
5. Set stop loss BEFORE entry

### Position Sizing

```
Risk Per Trade = Portfolio × 1-2%
Position Size = Risk / (Entry - Stop Loss)
```

### The Kill Switch

Use it when:
- Max drawdown hit
- Emotional state compromised
- Market conditions unclear
- Need to step away
